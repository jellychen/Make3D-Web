Online 3D Modeling Software Service Statement

=== Welcome to Make3d ===
Empowering creators, engineers, and designers with a seamless ​online 3D modeling platform, Make3d is committed to safeguarding your privacy and intellectual property. This Service Statement outlines our pledge to protect your data and creative works.

=== Data Collection & Usage Policy ===
    We do not intentionally store or retain any user-generated data, including 3D models, drafts, or project files, unless explicitly authorized by you or required by law.
Session-specific data (e.g., unsaved work-in-progress files, editing history) is stored temporarily in memory during your active session and ​permanently deleted upon logout or browser closure.
No backups or archives: Deleted files, versions, or drafts are ​irretrievable and not retained in any form, including cloud storage or archival systems.

    You may optionally share project files or collaboration permissions with third parties, but all sharing requires ​explicit consent and can be revoked at any time.
No automatic uploads: Files are ​not synced to external services (e.g., social media, cloud platforms) without your direct action.

    We do not log or analyze your modeling patterns, workflow habits, or file access frequency.
No metadata retention: Exported files (OBJ, STL, GLB, etc.) are stripped of all metadata tied to your account.

=== Security & Privacy Measures ===
    End-to-End Encryption: All data transmitted during modeling sessions is encrypted using TLS 1.3+ protocols.
    
    Zero-Knowledge Architecture: Our servers act solely as intermediaries; ​we do not decrypt, analyze, or store your files for any purpose.

    Regular Security Audits: Independent third-party auditors conduct annual penetration testing and compliance reviews to ensure adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001 standards.

    AI-Free Surveillance: No machine learning algorithms monitor or profile user behavior or content.

=== User Data Rights ===
    Account Deletion: You may request the deletion of your account and all associated data within ​7 business days. We guarantee complete erasure of records.
    
    Data Portability: Export projects in standard 3D formats (OBJ, STL, GLB) without附加 metadata.
    
    Access Logs: Review logs of account activity (IP addresses, timestamps) if required for security investigations.
